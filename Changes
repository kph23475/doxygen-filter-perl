v1.62 - 2014-02-04
    Changes
        Zbynek Vyskovsky submitted a patch to fix the following issues and add the 
        following functionality:
        Fix issue with white spaces and empty lines in comments
        Added more flexibility regarding the types of attributes. Now it's not only 
            possible to specify variable type as scalar, hash or array, but in general 
            any type like void, int or in package::Class format. The same applies for 
            methods where it's now possible to specify return type of the method in 
            similar way.
        Added error reporting in case of incorrect syntax
        Removed dependency for the ~~ operator
        Attributes and methods now understand static and const keyword and passes them 
            to doxygen. For global variables it automatically adds static.
        Order of methods/functions is now kept and left up to doxygen to reorganize 
            the order if needed.
        @fn/@function now stands for static function and it's automatically added, 
            @method is always instance method (unless explicitly mentioning static).
v1.61 - 2013-09-23
    Changes
        Zbynek Vyskovsky submitted a patch to fix the following issues:
        for top level classes (main especially) the generated class name was empty
        @var were processed but not printed to the output
v1.60 - 2013-08-14
    Changes
        Zbynek Vyskovsky submitted a patch to fix the following issues:
        Sometimes the annotations were not processed at all, sometimes there were 
            unexpected "main" classes.
        Additionally the processing of inheritance was hardcoded to always include 
            parent package instead of checking for presence of @ISA variable or "base" module.
        There were also several problems caused misunderstanding of generated code by 
            doxygen as there is no equivalent of some perl packages constructs in C++.
v1.50 - 2012-07-06

v0.99_01 - Initial Alpha Release (2011-10-21)
    Differences from DoxyGenFilter
        This represents a complete rewrite of the code and attempts to provide 
        a frame work from which we can greatly expand the functionality over time.
        We also build up a document object of the code that allows us to pull things
        in from various places and relate them all correctly. 
    New Features
        We current support the following doxygen structural indicators
            @file
            @fn (@function and @method)
        All section indicators should work under each structural indicators that we support
        Verbatim formatting keeps comment "#" tags
        We use the VERSION variable from the code in the file output definition
        The @method and @function documentation blocks can reside inside or outside
            the actual subroutines that they are tied to.
    Known Issues
        POD support is not yet included
        Only two structural indicators are currently supported - more to com
